## Launch ESIPFED jupyter cloud computer

Go to http://pangeo.esipfed.org and log in with your github credentials. Note, this will only work if you are a member of the [cdi-workshops github group](https://github.com/cdi-workshops) (invitation only)

When your server starts up, you should see a jupyter in traditional 'tree' view

You can work in newer 'lab' view instead by modifying the url from 'tree' to 'lab'
